# SecureDocumentSigning
A secure and user-friendly application designed to sign and verify electronic documents, ensuring their authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation. The project uses SHA-256 for hashing and RSA (2048-bit key size) for public-private key cryptography, enabling secure digital signature generation and verification. Developed in Java with a graphical interface built using Swing, the application includes robust error handling and supports various document formats. This system is ideal for contexts such as legal agreements and sensitive business communications, providing reliable and efficient document signing solutions.
